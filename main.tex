\section{Introduction}
% Motivate  and  introduce  the  problem  you  are  solving. Very briefly summarize your methodology, your experiments, and your important results.

Currently there are no secure identity platforms where an individual can prove
who they are in a timely and secure fashion. Right now, the United States uses things
like social security numbers, but these numbers can be stolen easily. We would like to
provide a solution where a person can prove their identity, citizenship, and potentially
other things like credit without having to worry about losing permanent identifiers like a
social security number.
